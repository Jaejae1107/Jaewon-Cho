      <p>
        I’m Jaewon Cho, currently pursuing a Bachelor’s in Computer Engineering at Purdue University, set to graduate in May 2025. I have a strong interest in Data Science and currently serve as an undergraduate researcher with the SAS ORSOL team, working on analyzing electric vehicle charging demand using synthetic data. This experience has deepened my understanding of predictive modeling and large-scale data analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m interested in multi-modal learning, efficient and robust Machine Learning, and applications towards healthcare.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond academia, I find joy in hearing people’s stories, reading, playing tennis, and immersing myself in music. 
        Sports and music are a huge part of my life.
