      <p>
        I’m Juhyun Lee. I graduated from Chung-Ang University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in French Literature and a double major in Statistics. 
        I worked as a research assistant in the ET lab led by Professor Il-Youp Kwak and collaborated with Professor Junyeong Kim on research 
        mitigating bias in AI systems. My research motivated me to develop deep learning models to make a positive impact.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond academia, I find joy in hearing people’s stories, reading, playing tennis, and immersing myself in music.
        Sports and music are a huge part of my life.
