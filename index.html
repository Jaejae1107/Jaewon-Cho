      <p>
        I’m Jaewon Cho. I graduated from Purdue University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in French Literature and a double major in Statistics.
        I worked as a research assistant in the ET lab led by Professor Il-Youp Kwak. I also collaborated with Professor Junyeong Kim, 
        conducting research on mitigating bias in AI systems. My research experiences motivated me to develop deep learning models 
        to make a positive impact.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m interested in multi-modal learning, efficient and robust Machine Learning, and applications towards healthcare.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond academia, I find joy in hearing people’s stories, reading, playing tennis, and immersing myself in music. 
        Sports and music are a huge part of my life.
